# On-chain Flashcard System

## Project Title
On-chain Flashcard System

## Project Description
The On-chain Flashcard System is a decentralized application built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to create, store, and retrieve flashcards directly on the blockchain. Each flashcard consists of a question and an answer, and is associated with the address of the user who created it. This system offers transparency and immutability for users to securely store educational content in a decentralized way.

## Project Vision
The vision of the On-chain Flashcard System is to create a decentralized educational platform where users can create and share flashcards without relying on central authorities. The system aims to leverage blockchain technology to provide an immutable and transparent method of storing educational content, making it globally accessible and secure.

## Future Scope
- **Flashcard Marketplace**: A feature where users can sell or trade their flashcards.
- **Multimedia Support**: Adding support for multimedia content (images, videos, etc.) in flashcards.
- **Tokenization**: Integration of a token for incentivizing users to contribute quality content.
- **Interactive Quizzes**: Implementing an interactive quiz feature that utilizes flashcards to create educational challenges.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Storage**: All flashcards are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring that they are immutable and transparent.
- **Simple Flashcard Creation**: Users can create flashcards with just a question and answer.
- **Creator Tracking**: Each flashcard is linked to the creatorâ€™s address, providing full ownership and accountability.
- **Event-driven**: Smart contract emits an event whenever a flashcard is created, providing an auditable log of actions.
